# Heart_Disease_Prediction

#Project Overview

The Heart Disease Prediction project leverages machine learning techniques to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health metrics and lifestyle factors. The objective is to develop a predictive model that can assist healthcare professionals in early diagnosis and risk assessment, ultimately promoting preventive care.

# Objectives:

Predictive Modeling: Utilize machine learning algorithms to classify individuals as at risk or not at risk for heart disease.

Data Analysis: Analyze key factors contributing to heart disease, such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and lifestyle habits.

User-Friendly Interface: Provide an accessible interface for users to input their health data and receive predictions.

# Key Features:

Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the dataset for analysis, including handling missing values and feature scaling.

Model Selection: Experimentation with various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Support Vector Machines) to identify the most effective model.

Model Evaluation: Use metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess model performance and ensure reliability.

Visualization: Implement data visualizations to illustrate correlations and insights from the dataset.

# Technologies Used:

Programming Languages: Python (with libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib).

Machine Learning Frameworks: Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation.

Data Visualization: Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualizing data and results.

# Result:

Achieved an accuracy rate of 85% in Random Forest Classifier.
